# Virtual-mouse
Simple app that enables user to use hand movement as mouse.

The project uses MediaPipe framework to perform computer vision inference and OpenCV modules for image/video handling.

The pointing is done with just forefinger beeing up. 
The click happens, when forefinger and thumb reach some critical distance.
